                    <p>
                        I have always been a problem solver. I seek out what is possible (even what it seems as though it may
                        not be
                        possible) and then make it happen. To me, the challenge of figuring out a solution is the fun part.
                        Working as a
                        Customer Success Manager (CSM) at LinkedIn I’ve come across many challenges that I’ve solved, but I
                        won’t get into
                        that now.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What I have come to realize (and I may have always known) is that I want to solve bigger problem simply
                        for the joy
                        of being able to sit with a question/problem/situation and solve my way through it. Often, it’s a
                        struggle, but
                        finding the solution to make whatever work is such a rush that the time and energy put in (and the
                        failures along
                        the way) is all worth it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I know it’s this desire to solve problems that has led me into programming.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But it wasn’t until the fall of 2018, during the LinkedIn NYC Engineering Showcase, that I had this
                        realization. I
                        proceeded to walk around to each the booths – from the video team, editorial, to the content ingestion,
                        and to the
                        SRE teams. Once I started talking to an engineer at each booth, things started to click for me. Prior to
                        that day, I
                        hadn’t seen programming before as a way to solve problems, but it became abundantly clear that problem
                        solving was
                        at the core of every application and program.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I thought about what brought me the most joy at work, I came to the conclusion that it was the
                        times that
                        questions came up that I didn’t know the answer to... it was the times that I got to spend digging into
                        details...
                        it was the time I spent asking questions.... it was the time I spent learning something new... and then
                        the chance
                        to share my findings with others so that their question had a definitive answer (at least until another
                        question
                        arose).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Upon reflecting on that day at the NYC Engineering Showcase, I knew that my next step was going to be
                        towards
                        programming and that I wanted to be an Engineer myself.
                        <p>
                            My next step was research. I explored who I knew internally at LinkedIn, met some new folks in NYC,
                            and asked
                            about how they got into engineering. I also talked with my manager early on and shared with her my
                            desire for
                            this “next play” into a technical role and got her buy in for me to further pursue this direction. I
                            also
                            leveraged my network as a Culture Champion and connected with colleagues in other offices to gather
                            similar
                            details and to explore what sort of courses or bootcamps could be the right fit for the tech stack
                            at LinkedIn,
                            and in general for learning as much as possible. An on top of that, dabbled in some LinkedIn
                            Learning courses.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I discovered that the New York Public Library offers free coding classes (way to go, New York!). So,
                            I enrolled
                            for the first phase which was basic HTML/CSS (just the tip of the iceberg). And this is where my
                            fascination
                            began to take form. I started to see the patterns that existed throughout the web and wanted to move
                            into the
                            core programming languages more quickly. The issue though was that the pace of this class was... a
                            little slow.
                            So, I went back researching and had to decide if I wanted to cherry pick different classes that
                            focused on very
                            specific topics or enroll in a bootcamp that mapped out tech that layered on top of each other. I
                            opted for the
                            latter.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Right now, I am enrolled in the Columbia Engineering Full Stack Coding Bootcamp which I have been
                            taking over
                            the course of 6 months (I opted for the part-time version so that I could continue working at
                            LinkedIn while
                            learning these new skills) – I will fully complete this bootcamp in September 2019, but have already
                            built
                            multiple full stack applications. The technology and frameworks we are using throughout the bootcamp
                            consists of
                            HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Java, Bootstrap, Node.js, Ajax, Express.js, React.js, ORM, CRUD,
                            Sequelize,
                            Database Theory, MongoDB, and MySQL (to name a few) – plus many libraries and other packages.
                            Although I’ve
                            learned a whole lot already, there is a lot more I have left to learn. And then a whole lot more
                            after that. And
                            then after that, more learning to do still as there are always new pieces of technology getting
                            released and
                            faster ways to solve the same problems – not to mention the unique ways that companies house data,
                            collaborate
                            with other teams and multi-products, and build applications at incredible scale.
